By the end of Social Networks, you will be better able to:

- Understand the graphML format used by many network packages and software programs
- Use Gephi to visualise networks and customise nodes and edges
- Analyse and interpret the most important nodes in the network
- Create a (pretty/fancy) figure of a (social) network as output

By the end of this session (Biomedical NLP), you will be better able to:

- Perform data cleaning and pre-processing of free text data (e.g., abstracts from papers)
- Apply topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- Visualise summaries of free text data using Wordclouds

Before Biomedical NLP, ensure you have installed the following packages (others are needed but assumed to already be installed):
```
pip install gensim nltk tqdm wordcloud
pip install -U spacy
```
